## ✅ Version 1 (Day 1): Single-Round Game

### 🎯 Purpose:
- Learn how to use `input()`, `if-elif-else` conditionals
- Use `random.randint()` to simulate computer choices
- Compare values and determine a game outcome
- Handle invalid input
- Play one round only

### 💡 Features:
- Asks the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors
- Computer picks randomly
- Determines the winner
- Only plays **once**

---

## 🔁 Version 2 (Day 2): Replayable Game with Quit and Score

### 🎯 Purpose:
- Introduce `while True` loops for continuous play
- Use `break` to exit and `continue` to re-prompt
- Add a `"quit"` option
- Track score with variables across rounds

### 💡 Features:
- Repeats the game until the user types `"quit"`
- Keeps score of player and computer wins
- Gives feedback on invalid input
- Shows final score summary after quitting

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Input validation
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`, `break`, `continue`)
- Random selection using `random.randint()`
- Scorekeeping with variables

## 💡 Project by Design

This project is designed to:
- Scaffold student learning in manageable steps
- Emphasize testing and debugging logic
- Offer meaningful extensions such as:
  - Best-of-3 mode
  - Two-player mode
  - Scoreboard with ties
  - Adding new gestures (e.g. Lizard, Spock)
